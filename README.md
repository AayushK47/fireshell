```

## Usage

### Connecting the shell with the database


To start the shell, simply run `fireshell` in your terminal. You will be prompted a few questions.

First you'll have to choose the service you want to connect with :-

Then you have to provide the **absolute path** to your firebase config file. It has to be a JSON file that you get from firebase to connect your application with your firebase project.

The last prompt will ask you to enter the reltime database url. If you chose firestore in the 1st prompt, then your can ignore this question. Otherwise, enter the url.

### Writing Queries

Your queries must start with the keyword `db`. This `db` is a variable that stores reference to the database object. You can chain the rest of your query as you normally do.

For realtime database, make sure that you end any read query or any query that returns some data with the `once` method and pass `value` as its argument.

#### Examples of realtime database queries

```
// Create operation
> db.ref().child('user').set({name: "Iron Man", "alter-ego": "Tony Stark"})
```

<br />

```
// Read operation
> db.ref().child('user').once('value')
```

<br />

```
// Update operation
> db.ref().child('user').update({name: "Batman", "alter-ego": "Bruce Wayne"})
```

<br />

```
// Delete operation
> db.ref().child('user').remove()
```

#### Examples of cloud firestore queries

```
// Create operation
> db.collection('user').add({name: "Spiderman", "alter-ego": "Peter Parker"})
```

<br />

```
// Read operation
> db.collection('user').get()
```

<br />

```
// Update operation
> db.collection('user').doc('some-id').update({name: "Flash", "alter-ego": "Barry Allen"})
```

<br />

```
// Delete operation
> db.collection('user').doc('some-id').delete()
```
